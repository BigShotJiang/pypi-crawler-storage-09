Each contributor maintains copyright\n        over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these\n        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter\n        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\n        institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter\n        Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\n        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\n        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\n        change to one of the Jupyter repositories.\n        \n        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\n        to indicate the copyright and license terms:\n        \n            # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.\n            # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.\n        \n        \n        Pytest Tornasync File License\n        =============================\n        \n        The pytest_jupyter/pytest_tornasync.py was originally licensed as:\n        \n        The MIT License (MIT)\n        \n        Copyright (c) 2016 eukaryote\n        \n        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n        of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n        in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n        to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n        copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n        furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n        \n        The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n        copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n        \n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n        IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
